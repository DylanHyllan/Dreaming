                <h4>Jungian archetypes / Collective unconscious</h4>
                <p>The jungian archetypes are part of the collective unconscious and are shared across all cultures around the world. There are several archetypes and each one represents different emotions and feelings. The trickster archetype can be used by the unconscious to cause chaos in order or make serious situations slightly more trivial. This can be useful to for example, balance the mind or realize truths you otherwise, likely wouldn’t. Everyone has all the archetypes, what differentiates these archetypes from person to person is how much you use one over the other. This preference is often based on experiences and beliefs which become more stable later in life when your personality is not constantly exploring and changing.</p>
                <p>The mother archetype is used by the mind as a mother figure which is usually the woman who raised you and this archetype represents love and caring. Jung believed that, to an extent, other living animals also operated similarly to the jungian archetypes as an evolutionary advantage through instinctual behavior. For instance, Micheal Fordham, a child psychiatrist and jungian analyst, argued that when the female figure who represents the mother in a young animal appears, it triggers a feeding response which otherwise wouldn’t happen if any other creature was there. This could be to better recognize danger and promote a higher survival chance in young animals.</p>

                <h4>Personal unconscious</h4>
                <p>The personal unconscious is a key aspect of personality and differs from the collective unconscious in that it’s based on personal experiences and what is unique to the individual person. The personal unconscious consists of thoughts, memories and experiences that have been either forgotten, repressed or haven’t been acknowledged, thus, being a part of the unconscious part of the mind. Although consciousness could possibly access parts of the personal unconscious, it still contains truly unknown information that one couldn’t retrieve, despite efforts. </p>

                <h4>The Ego</h4>
                <p>The ego is the center of consciousness and plays a significant role in the psyche. It’s what you would consider “you” and it is through the ego that you view the world and process information. If you were to point at what you would consider your personality it would be the ego. However, The ego isn’t the totality of the true self, rather it’s a part of it. This is because The ego is the section of the psyche that you are most familiar with and understand the most as it is by using the ego that you experience everything and your decision making is decided. </p>
                <p>The way an individual processes information is unique to himself due to different cognitive functions. Through the cognitive functions does the ego handle its surroundings. There are four main aspects of the cognitive functions which are the following: extroversion/introversion, thinking/feeling, sensing/intuition and judging/perceiving. Every single person possesses all eight cognitive functions but leans towards one side more than the other which is what causes differences in the general population's information processing. If one's ego slightly prefers thinking over feeling, he would be more inclined to think with his brain rather than his heart and be more likely to be logical and consider more objectively based opinions rather than emotional ones that are decided through values and feelings. These differences in cognitive functions influence behavior and may cause one's external image to be seen similarly to the preferred cognitive function such as introversion or extroversion which many may be familiar with.</p>
                <p>The ego is highly influenced by other parts of the psyche such as the Personal, and collective unconscious. One of these is the persona which is an archetype that has the potential to highly influence the ego. The persona is what is created due to social norms in society. In early childhood you will realize that certain aspects of you are expected which is when the persona begins to develop. This archetype is correlated with the ego by adopting social behaviors to satisfy it. In a hypothetical scenario where the ego is concerned with being embarrassed, the persona will shield the ego by preventing situations that may cause this to occur. </p>
                <p>On the other side of the collective unconscious lies the shadow with its interesting relationship with the ego and the persona, of which were mentioned previously. In the perspective of the ego, the shadow seems to play the evil role while the persona usually plays the heroic role. However, the persona and the shadow interact in special ways by influencing each other which you could notice in someone through their ego. The shadow contains your repressed or unwanted emotions that, similarly to the persona, may have built up due to requirements from society. What causes the contrasting difference between the persona and the shadow is that the persona contains what your ego initially seeks and wants while the shadow contains what you hide and condemn. </p>

                <h4>Individuation</h4>
                <p>individuation is the process of realizing one's true self. This process involves many steps and requires an extensive amount of effort and time in order to be achieved. The process of individuation can be compared to nirvana in Buddhism where you reach a state of transcendence through enlightenment after a thorough and lengthy lifelong process. This self realization process is the ultimate reason that gives dreams their extremely significant role in jungian psychology. This is because many of the aspects of the psyche are near unreachable by one's consciousness which makes it highly difficult for you to realize deep and hidden traits within the complex psyche. However, these can be revealed through various methods which include dreams.</p>

                <h4>Dreams</h4>
                <p>Dreams are the primary way for the unconscious to communicate with the conscious mind. They function like gateways to parts of the mind that you are yet to be cognizant of.
                    This has a large number of benefits in several different ways. The precise way dreams are connected to the rest of the psyche can be complex which is why a rudimentary understanding of different Jungian theories are beneficial or even necessary to be able to comprehend the significance of dreams in the eyes and mind of Carl Jung.
                    </p>
                <p>One way dreams are useful to the psyche is through balancing. Jung believed that the psyche wants to strive for balance. This is something that dreams can do by functioning as compensation to your consciousness. They can do this by opposing exaggerated emotions and feelings from the waking state and displaying these in a dream. If, for instance, an individual is overly rational, he would experience extreme emotions that would challenge his inflated reality in order to balance it out.</p>
                <p>The Jungian archetypes play a massive role when it comes to dreams. Different archetypes representing themselves in different ways are shown to you while dreaming. The shadow archetype, which represents the repressed part of oneself, may appear as the threat while the wise old man, which symbolizes knowledge or wisdom, could be the guiding light or spiritual mentor. If you learn to understand the symbols and messages from the archetypes presented in your dreams, you’ll not only realize the personal mind but also the universal one by being aware of the parts of us that are shared across the globe in countless cultures.</p>
                <p>Although symbols can have a universal meaning such as archetypes, Jung believed that the interpretation of most symbols are subjective and not to be immediately decided through some manual. Carl Jung referred to this as the amplification method where the dreamer is the one and only person to decide the true intent and meaning behind several different symbols within their dream. Take a snake for an example, one might interpret this as a symbol of growth or renewal due its inherent ability to shed, whereas another individual may recognize the snake as dangerous or scary, possibly due to its lethality.</p>
                <p>According to Carl Jung, even nightmares are important and possess a meaningful role to be taken into consideration. A nightmare can be used as a clear sign from the unconscious that something is urgent and requires immediate attention which could be because the individual is resisting. The issue that is causing the person trouble may be unclear to his conscious self which is why the ego might feel threatened when the person is going through something difficult or changing a part of himself. The ego does often get defensive which is normal, and one of the ways the ego can tell you it doesn’t approve of something you are doing is by giving you a nightmare as a sign. However this doesn’t mean the ego is “right”, it simply doesn’t like the change and therefore discourages you from causing it to occur.</p>
                <p>A particular set of circumstances may also have the potential to provoke dreams into becoming recurring ones. Recurring dreams has its own importance and has its individual meaning when dreaming. If a dreamer for any reason neglects the issue that is being presented in a dream, it can cause it to happen again, and again until the source of the problem has been addressed. The unconscious won’t easily give up on an important message as it could be vital for the balance that the psyche is striving and working towards.</p>
                <p>The individuation process requires a balance and being conscious of the entire psyche which is why dreams are so important. They allow different parts of the mind to communicate so an individual can become aware of more areas regarding the self and not strictly the conscious division. Since the entirety of the mind can’t be accessed on will, dreams allow it to happen by opening a gateway between them. Sometimes the information that has to be addressed can be sensitive and avoided by the individual, but is crucial in the individuation process, which is where dreaming about them against their will is so beneficial since it forces them to deal with it and let it into their conscious state. The issue can exist so deep in the shadow and personal unconscious that understanding dreams can become essential and mandatory to find the true self and become whole.</p>
