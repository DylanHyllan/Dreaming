                <h4>Conscious, preconscious and unconscious</h4>
                <p>Freud (1917-1919), in Introduction to Psychoanalysis, explains the three layers of the mind: consciousness, preconsciousness, and unconsciousness. They contain fundamental parts of the mind that function through its respective layer. The id, the ego and the superego touch different layers of the mind which causes them to be used in unique and special areas of life. Sigmund Freud (1917-1919) compared these layers to an iceberg where the tip of it only represents a small portion of the iceberg while the rest of it is hidden underneath the surface water which we cannot see.</p>
                <p>The conscious mind represents the tip of the iceberg. relative to the totality of the iceberg, this section is small in size which therefore causes it to also be quite limited comparatively. Consciousness is awareness, it is what we are currently processing such as our senses and thoughts. Through rational thinking and logic, this part is responsible for our decision making which happens after deliberate information processing. Though it might seem you are in control of yourself through your consciousness, the rest of the mind plays a larger and more notable part in this matter, of which you are not as conscious of as you might initially believe.</p>
                <p>The unconscious mind represents the hidden part of the iceberg, located under the surface water. This is the largest and most significant part but is also the most unknown and mysterious section of the mind because it contains the deepest and most emotional information of the psyche that we are not even aware of. The information that lies here includes repressed emotions, irrational wishes, deep fears, traumatic experiences, primal instincts, aggressive urges, and unresolved conflicts. Although we are not aware of anything inside our unconsciousness, it still influences our daily lives in different ways.</p>
                <p>The preconscious is the fading line between consciousness and unconsciousness while still being its own distinct and respective layer which therefore places it right where the surface water touches the iceberg that also extends a distance below. This part of the mind functions as a bridge between two completely separate worlds and therefore also has mixed properties of both. Similarly to how the unconscious stores fundamental information of your psyche, so does the preconscious. However, unlike the unconscious, the information stored there can be retrieved to consciousness like for example your earliest memories that you are not currently thinking about. This is also a reason that Freud (1917-1919) referred to the preconscious as a sort of storage room for thoughts with the potential to enter consciousness. Due to the preconscious mind's ability to function as a gateway, information that is hidden and repressed in the unconscious can suddenly slip into the preconscious which then has the possibility to resurface into consciousness, thus revealing deeply buried memories.</p>

                <h4>The id, the ego, and the superego</h4>
                <p>According to Freud (1923), in The Ego and the Id, the psyche is divided into three main sections, which he named Es, Ich and Über-ich, which we refer to as the id, the ego and the superego. All three are located in different parts of the mind and develop in early childhood in the following order, the id, the ego, and finally the superego. This is because the ego and mostly the superego being influenced and even shaped by external factors. The combination of these three factions in the psyche become the basis of your personality and behavior by interacting and clashing with one another due to completely different principles. The psyche is often compared to a devil and angel on your shoulder where the id is the devil and the superego is the angel, the ego is then the judge of these two opposites.</p>
                <p>The id, or Es, lies solely in the unconscious division of the mind and is the portion of the psyche that you are born with, unlike the ego and superego. In the id lies nothing except primal instincts and urges. The id has no consideration for the external world and seeks immediate gratification by any means necessary which Freud (1923) named, the pleasure principle. This is why the id is considered to be the devil on your shoulder that is continuously nagging you. The impulses created here are devoid of morality or logic and can relate to nearly anything, some of which are essential for survival. A newborn baby will scream if hungry with no regards to anybody, the baby will demand food so he doesn’t become malnourished and can grow. According to Sigmund Freud (1923), this constant drive for your personal needs and instant pleasure derives from what he called libido which fuels and guides the id which we today recognize as the source of sexual desire that however, he was not exclusively referring to.</p>
                <p>The ego, also known as ich in German, is a section of the psyche that starts to develop within the first few years of life. This happens because the individual is now starting to obtain a better understanding of the world around him after an extensive amount of interactions with it. Although the ego is primarily located in the conscious part of the mind and therefore sits at the tip of the iceberg, it also dips into your preconsciousness. The ego functions by what Freud (1923) would call the reality principle meaning that it attempts to realistically please the id's desires in a way that is socially acceptable by acting as a sort of mediator. The ego is considered the mediator because it tries to observe both the devil and the angel’s arguments, Since the ego mediates between the id and the superego, it ultimately makes a rational decision weighing both sides logically as a judge. Additionally, when the ego perceives that the id’s demands are excessively stressful or morally unacceptable, it deploys defense mechanisms to repress these thoughts. However, to trigger this defense mechanism a small unconscious part of the ego that lies in the unconscious exists that handles these situations without your awareness.</p>
                <p>The superego, or Über-ich in German, Is the last division of the psyche to develop which occurs around the age of 5-6 due to expectations and learned behavior from the external world. The principle present in the superego is the moral principle. This is due to the superego being accountable for distinguishing right from wrong. It stands for morality, ethics and social rules because it contains values that have meaning. Actions aligned with the superego can reward you with pridefulness while neglecting it can make you feel shameful or guilty. Although it may seem that the superego means nothing except good intentions, it can unfortunately impose unrealistic expectations which can cause negative feelings. These expectations may even be meant for something completely harmless and unnecessary.  The ego has an idea of a perfect self that meets all expectations which may as well be utterly impossible to actually achieve in reality. This is why the superego can be divided into two separate parts, the conscious and the ego-ideal. Our conscience discourages us from opposing our moral values and beliefs whilst the ego-ideal rewards, and encourages us to be the best version of ourselves.</p>

                <h4>Dreams</h4>
                <p>Sigmund Freud (1899) in The Interpretation of Dreams would change psychology as we know it today. In fact, it was so influential that it would even reach completely different fields such as literature and art. Its large significance became the foundation and basis of psychoanalytic theory and dream interpretation which is still used today. According to the book, Freud's general view was that dreaming was a form of wish fulfillment stemming from the repressed part of the psyche. In his book he explained that you have the ability to access your unconsciousness by analysing experiences you’ve had while dreaming. This is because Freud (1899) argued that your dreams are manifested by deep desires and conflicts in your psyche which would make it close to impossible to realize otherwise if it were not for dreams. As Sigmund Freud (1899) famously said, “The interpretation of dreams is the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind."</p>
                <p>The id, the ego and the superego play massive roles to the content and meaning of dreams. Due to the id being controlled by the pleasure principle it can manifest as aggressive urges. Since the id lies in the unconscious, much of its content, if not all, is unknown to one's awareness. Dreams allow these urges and emotions to surface, often in symbolic ways. At the opposite end lies the superego which causes feelings of guilt or pride based on an individual's actions. The superego may therefore generate dreams where one is getting punished for giving in to the id's pleasure principle in the form of a nightmare. Then we have the ego's innate reality principle that compromises and disguises the dreams from the extremes of the superego and especially the id. The id tends to produce highly immoral and disturbing motifs that need censoring which the ego tries to take care of by reshaping imagery in a way that is more acceptable. This is why the id is often disguised as symbols instead of its raw and naked nature. Together, these three parts of the psyche, form a dream conflict where they are contesting one another which may cause the individual who’s dreaming to experience the dream as odd and irrational.</p>
                <p>Due to conflicting forces and heavy symbolism, analysing dreams, let alone understanding the most basic purpose of their occurrence, was too complicated and difficult to do.   Sigmund Freud therefore constructed what he called dream work so one could better comprehend the meaning of them. The process of dream work consists of 4 main divisions being condensation, displacement, symbolization, and finally secondary revision. Together forming the full and coherent process and all the stages of dreams.</p>
                <p>Condensation is the first step of the process. Multiple different unconscious desires are fused to create one single part of a dream, acting as a sort of encryption. This could be an event, symbol or image that is displayed to you. This prevents repressed thoughts from being displayed completely in its true form and straightforward manner. This means that a symbol in a dream has the potential to possess multiple meanings, some of which being complete opposites of each other. The purpose of this section of the dream work is to decrease the chances that the dreamer will realize its true meaning and trigger waking anxiety. Waking anxiety refers to the feeling one might have when waking up. It’s a feeling of intense anxiety as its name suggests. All dreams however do not try to prevent waking anxiety, and as a matter of fact, there exist dreams that are referred to as anxiety dreams.</p>
                <p>The second part of dream work is displacement. Similarly to condensation, The purpose of displacement is to hide the true meaning of aggressive thoughts and desires within a dream in order to decrease the chances of eventually causing waking anxiety. Since certain things can be extremely intense emotionally to an individual, it just can’t be shown as it is and needs a camouflage in order to be represented in any shape or form. Displacement therefore displaces these unconscious thoughts to objects that are of far less significance. This means that a very strong emotion can be displayed as something completely different inside the dream, though still with a slight correlation or resemblance to its true intent. This is because of displacement. This means that the ego conscious does not become aware of it as easily and you in turn remain collected. Because of this process, a dream, in its entirety, may appear of little to no importance emotionally to an individual while its true and hidden meaning could be a deeply personal nightmare.</p>
                <p>Symbolization is the representation of the unconscious thoughts that you bear. Your thoughts may be too abstract to serve any significant meaning inside a dream in its original form. Therefore, the process of symbolization converts them into tangible imagery that you may experience. Moreover, symbolization can help bypass restrictions made by the conscious mind. Since your repressed thoughts may be highly censored, this process allows them to ignore it in the form of symbols. The conversion to concrete symbolism, imposed by the symbolization process can be in the form of anything in general such as everyday objects. However, Sigmund Freud (1899) stressed that the specific forms that your thoughts are converted to are not universal, and are unique to the individual and their personal experiences in their own life. For this very reason, Freud (1899) further expressed that the dreamer must realize what the symbols mean to himself rather than attempting to search for the answer using “dream dictionaries”, emphasizing the importance of effective and accurate dream analysis.</p>
                <p>Only after condensation, displacement and symbolization has taken effect, secondary revision is triggered. Once secondary revision is in process, its role is to create a smooth and consistent dream out of the material from the previous processed content from dream work. Without secondary revision, The dream would become a giant, illogical and fragmented mess. This is because the mind wants to make sense of the information and give it a purpose and a story is therefore constructed that can be followed in comparison to the mess. However, much like the other divisions of dream work, this process further disguises the true meaning of its content and deciphering it will require even more effort from the dreamer. This is because seemingly unrelated subjects may be entangled in the same scene of a particular dream which distorts its purpose in a mysterious blend. Since the already encrypted information from the past processes have taken effect, extensive analysis will be necessary in order to decode and understand its puzzling message.</p>
